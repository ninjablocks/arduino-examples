Arduino Examples
================
In this repository, you will find example Arduino code you can compile and flash to your NinjaPi Crust or BeagleBone Cape. For instructions on how to flash your cape/crust, click [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140704080411/http://ninjablocks.com/blogs/how-to/8465455-compiling-the-ninja-blocks-arduino-firmware). If you don't want to compile each example, there is a precompiled hex in each example for your convenience. 

Enjoy!
